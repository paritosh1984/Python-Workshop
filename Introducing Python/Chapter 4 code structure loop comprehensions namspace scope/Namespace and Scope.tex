\frametitle{Namespaces and Scope}
\begin{itemize}
\item Names or variables can refer to different things based on where they are used.
\item A program has various namespaces which are regions in which a name is unique and not related to the same name in other namespaces.
\item Each program has its own namespace and likewise each function has its own namespace.
\item A variabel named 'a' in the main program is different from a variable inside a function, also named 'a'.
\item But a variable in the main program can be accessed from inside the function as it is part of the global namespace. The reverse is not true.
 
\end{itemize}
