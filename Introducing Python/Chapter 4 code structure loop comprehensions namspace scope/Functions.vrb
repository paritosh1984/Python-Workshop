\frametitle{Lambda Functions}
Lambda functions are used to create anonymous "on the go" functions in place of little function definitions that might not be reused later and is an overkill.

Lambda functions can be expressed in a single statement.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
my_lambda = lambda x : x*2

print(my_lambda(10))

\end{lstlisting}
