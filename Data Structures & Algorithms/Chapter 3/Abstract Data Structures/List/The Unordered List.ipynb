    "We have used Python lists to implement the abstract data types like Stacks and Queues.

In these cases, the notion of a list must be implemented by the programmer.\n",

    "A list is a collection of items where each item holds a relative position with respect to the\n",

    "the list as having a first item, a second item, a third item, and so on. We can also refer to the\n",
    "beginning of the list (the first item) or the end of the list (the last item). For simplicity we will\n",

    "The remove method requires two logical steps. First, we need to traverse the list looking for the\n",
    "item we want to remove. Once we find the item (recall that we assume it is present), we must\n",
    "remove it. The first step is very similar to search. Starting with an external reference set to the\n",
    "head of the list, we traverse the links until we discover the item we are looking for. Since we\n",
    "assume that item is present, we know that the iteration will stop before current gets to None.\n",
    "When it is found, current will be a reference to the node containing the item to be\n",
    "removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### But how do we remove it? \n",
    "\n",
    "One possibility would be to replace the value of the item with some marker that suggests that the item is no longer present. The problem with this\n",
    "approach is the number of nodes will no longer match the number of items. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Smarter Way to do It\n",
    "It would be much better to remove the item by removing the entire node.\n",
    "In order to remove the node containing the item, we need to modify the link in the previous\n",
    "node so that it refers to the node that comes after current. \n",

    "like to make the change, it is too late to make the necessary modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wallaaa.. The Solution\n",
    "The solution to this dilemma is to use two external references as we traverse down the linked\n",
    "list. current will behave just as it did before, marking the current location of the traverse. The\n",
    "new reference, which we will call previous, will always travel one node behind current. That\n",

It's regular programming convention to start from 0 and not 1.\n",

The problem with this change is that it could change the way our UnorderedList will be constructed because every time a new node has to be added now, we will have to pass an additional parameter for the index attribute.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The add method will always add items from one end of the list (to the head), whose position is always 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Therefore we set the parameter passed to a default value of zero. This will save us from keeping track of the index number to be supplied as part of adding new nodes and make the implementation more  robust."
