\frametitle{Anagram Detection Example}
Lets discuss Big-O Notation further with the Anagram example.
\begin{itemize}
\item A string is an anagram of another if the second string is simply a rearrangement of the first string.
\item For example, School Master is a rearrangement of The Classroom. Likewise "Astronomer" is an anagram of "Moon Starrer".
\item If the two strings are of  the same length and are made up of a combination of the 26 alphabets, we could easily analyze them.
\item Lets discuss two solutions to identifying an anagram and analyze their performances.
\item Code link to be shared.
\end{itemize}
